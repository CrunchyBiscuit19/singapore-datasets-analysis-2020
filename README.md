# Singapore Datasets Analysis 2020

* This data analysis is to determine the relationship between education, income, and the economy in Singapore. These 3 areas are interdependent and any change in 1 area could affect the others.
* This includes observing how the data changes between different time periods, and comparing data from multiple areas to work out how they are linked to one another.

### Setup
